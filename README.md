# AES_CPP
Implementation of AES using C++
To use call the function AES(pMSB, pLSB, kMSB, kLSB, choice) where:
-pMSB is the most significant 64 bits of plain text
-pLSB is the least significant 64 bits of plain text
-kMSB is the most significant 64 bits of key
-kLSB is the least significant 64 bits of key
-choice is 1 for encryption and 0 for decryption

for testing one can use the console interface provided by the main() function
